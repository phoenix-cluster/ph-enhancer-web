            <h3 id="spectral_clustering">Spectral Clustering</h3>
            <p> Many mass spectra from different experiments/labs may be derived from the same peptide, and they
                have a chance to look similar in the peak list. Spectra clustering could reveal this relationship and
                provides a new spect to do the data mining from these mass spectral data, such as detecting the low confident
                PSMs by checking the the assigned peptide sequence's ratio in a cluster, and referring new peptide sequence for the previous
                unidentified spectra if they are clustered with other identified spectra.
            </p>
            <p> PRIDE Cluster is developed by our collaborators to handle the clustering of millions of spectra[][],
                which has these advatages:
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1. Effectively handling huge number of spectra;</li>
                    <li>2. Clustering high heterogeneous spectra which could be high quality or low quality.</li>
                </ul>

            <p>
                PRIDE Cluster has released a clustered data based on all PRIDE Archive's public experiments by April 2015, which could be used as
                an useful data resource for data mining proteomics/peptideomics. This "201504" version contains 593 projects, 182 species, 38 kind of modifications.
                The cluster details could be explored at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/cluster/, the whole package data could be download from ftp://ftp.pride.ebi.ac.uk/pride/data/cluster/result-files.
                Some unidentified clusters with reasonable sizes are retrieved for different spices, which could be used as source of spectra archive searching[].
            </p>

            <h3 id="spectral_archive"> Spectral Archive Searching</h3>
            <p>
                When a user is willing to evaluate the originally database search PSMs, one way is to cluster all these PSMs
                with the clusters in PRIDE Cluster, which is possible but complicate. Here we suggest another way, to address
                the clusters as spectra archive and search the query spectra against the spectra archive built from PRIDE Cluster.
            </p>

            <p>
                <a herf="http://tools.proteomecenter.org/wiki/index.php?title=Software:SpectraST">SpectraST</a>[] is one component of TPP, which support Spectral Archive Searching from version ????.
                SpectraST calculating dot product scores between the query spectrum and the archive spectrum, and other features such as the distribution of the dot product scores are included to give
                the finally score <i>f_val</i>. In Phoenix Enhancer, we choose the default threshold 0.5 for <i>f_val</i> to accept the matches.
            </p>

            <h3 id="spectral_similarity"> Spectral Similarity</h3>
            <p>
                In PRIDE Cluster, the spectra similarity is calculated as this[]:
            </p>
            <ul>
                    <li>1. Filtering the peaks: selecting 70 highest peaks, and only the peaks that explain 50% of the total ion current but at least the top 25 are retained.</li>
                    <li>2. Using a hypergeometric distribution to model the probability of matching peaks come from random chance.</li>
                    <li>3. Using the Kendall-Tau score to calculate the similarity between the intensity ranks of the matched peaks ane then convert it
                                into a probability of obtain better by random chance.</li>
                    <li>4. These two probabilities are combined into a single p-value using Fisherâ€™s method.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                In SpectraST, the spectra similarity is calculated as this: ????
            </p>


            <h3 id="confidence_scoring"> Confidence Scoring </h3>
            <p> We developed a method to evaluate the confident level of previous PSMs based on the mathced cluster and the
                sequence ratio. We have developed a score function based on these principles:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>1. Peptide sequence gets positive confident score when their ratio is higher than 0.5, get positive score when less than 0.5;</li>
                <li>2. With the same ratio,  higher number of other sequences or more adequate distribution of others will get more score weight;</li>
                <li>3. Bigger cluster matched gives more weight to the confidence score, the highest weight is 1, which is gained by clusters >= 1000.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="run_a_job"> Running a Job </h2>
            <p> There are three steps to running an analysis job: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1. Upload your data which contains spectra, which could be identified or not;</li>
                    <li>2. Set parameters, such as thresholds;</li>
                    <li>3. Start the analysis and check the progress.</li>
                </ul>


            <h3 id="upload_data"> Upload Data</h3>
            <p>
                After selecting and uploading files, user will still need to click the "CONFIRM" button to confirm that all
                files have been uploaded. Before confirming, the user can delete the wrong files or upload with multiple steps.
            </p>
            <img src="/src/app/assets/help/upload_files.jpg">
            <p> </p>

            <h3 id="set_parameters"> Set Parameters and start Analysis</h3>
            <p>
            There are 3 type of parameters to set: the minimum cluster size, the email address of user, and to make this
            analysis job public or not. The minimum cluster size enable the user to avoid matching to the small clusters
            which have lower confidence to support the final score. The user address will be need to sent anlysis job id,
            token and final result. If the user agree to make his/her data and enhancing analysis, he/she can tick on the
            "Make Public" button, hence the others could see the enhancement result at our web site.

            <h2 id="results"> Results </h2>
            <p>
                We provide three kind of results for the previous PSMs or unidentified spectra:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Low confident PSMs</li>
                <li>High confident PSMs </li>
                <li>New PSM for undientifed spectra</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                By checking all these tables and the scores, and also comparing the spectra, users could decide to accept our
                enhancing suggestion or reject, by clicking the last column named "Acceptaince".
            </p>
            <h3 id="scored_psm_lists"> Scored PSM Lists</h3>
            <p>These three kinds of PSM lists are shown in three tables, with pagination and sorting supported.
                Interactive broswing are enabled for PSM distribution and spectra comparer, clicking on different row
                will get different distribution and spectra comparing shows.

            <h3 id="histogram_charts">Interactive Histogram Charts</h3>
            <p>PhoenixEnhancer provids three interactive histogram charts for "Confidence Score", "Cluster Ratio" and "Cluster Size".
                PSMs in current page (only in the sorted column) and selected PSM could be highligheted in the charts, to let the
                user have a whole perspective of the data.

            compares the spectral matches withtin a butterfly mode, to let users compare the matching details of the query spectra's peak list and the
                cluster consensus spectra's peak list.

                can get a pie chart to show the peptide qequence ratio distribution information.
            </p>
            <p>By clickong on the cluster_id, web page goes to a cluster details page. With in this page, users can get more informations about the cluster, such as the peptides's distribution, the projects distribution within a cluster.
                And also a spectra comparer are used here to compare the spectra in cluster and the cluster consensus spectra.
